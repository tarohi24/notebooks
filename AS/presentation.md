e.g. 🤔 the amount is 1T  😀 100g per person

## Question and Answer
### Say “Thank you” “Good question” for the questioner

### Re-organize the question and confirm it is correct

### Ask the questioner whether I made an adequate answer
Unless suggest to discuss it after the session.

## Atitude

(Case in Haruka Mera)
"I will have changed everything in my environment to English one for three weeks” she said. For example, she listens to music in English or read newspapers in English. She also takes video for the presentation, checking the behavior.
“I won’t let you down. Prepare for everything people demand to me.”
“Chances favors the prepared mind."
“Saying is one thing, and doing is another.” (いうこととやることは別である)
