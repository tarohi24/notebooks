# Academic Writing Skills

Here's mainly for scientific papers.
Everyone must have their own opinion.
Sometimes your idea conflicts what I write here.
Any discussion is welcome in [Issues](https://github.com/tarohi24/notebooks/issues)!


## Draw a Graph
- Smooth lines.
- Always show x-axis and y-axis.
- Don't contain too many lines in a figure.
- Distinguish ordered set from non-ordered set.
  - (e.g.) Node IDs are usually not ordered. We sholdn't use them in line graphs.
- 2D rather than 3D
- Circle graph is not recommended. It's only for showing the proportions roughly.
- Captions should be rich enough to understand it without reading the main text.
  - Instead, the main text describes the grounds why the results are creditable.
- Log-scaleing is useful to adjust appearance.
- Graph design is something we have to decide **before** we conduct experiments.


## Main contents
- Motivation is very important.
- Explain the background clearly.
  - What's the problem?
  - Why the problem matters?
  - Why did you solve the problem in that way?
- Logical consistency matters.
  - Do we have coherent sections (paragraphs)?
- Having what you write checked by someone else is a good choice.

## Styling
- Don't use abbreviations or citations in abstract.
- Unify styling (American / British English).
- Describe general things (time-agnostic facts) in the present tense, experimental results in the past tense.
- Prefer passive forms than passive forms.
- Explain all the abbreviations when they firstly emerges.
- Shorter sentence is better.
- Use capital character in prefixes. e.g. ðŸ™† Section 3 ðŸ™… section 3
- Don't insert "," when you combine phrases when the subject is identical.
  - ðŸ™† You said and left. ðŸ™… You said, and left. 


## What Referee Pay Attention to
(In case of EDAS)
- If the contents is strict scientifically.
- Novelity
- Uniqueness in ideas and results
- Quality of presentation
  - Are figures clear?
  - Are citations proper?


## TIPS for Each Section

### Discussion
- In short, describe what facts readers obtain.
- Even the correct results don't always lead to the adequate discussion.
- Don't present new facts in discussion.
- Discussion is not a summary.
- Write whether results in the paper are consistent with previous studies? And why?
  - So citing them is important.
- Explanation of Results (place them in context & explain whether unexpected)
- Deduction! (how to apply research & lessons learned)
- Are hypotheses proved?

### Conclusion
- Claim what matters in this paper.
- Just a paragprah is usually enough. The maximum is 3.
- If there's no room, merge with discussion.
- Show each key point and its proof bliefly.
