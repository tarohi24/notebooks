Research TIPS
==============

This notebook includes TIPS I have learned about research.


## Prof. Takashi Hara
### What theme should I choose?
Research theme is important. Even if your paper is accepted by a famous conference, the paper will go out of fashion in 5~10 years unless the theme is boring.

### A great researcher is good at attracting
They focus on problem statement, not solution.

### Question for common sense
e.g. Power saving is one of the popular theme in the U.S. But is it necessary? Nowadays buttery is enough powerful and small.

### Be good at another theme
* To set a convincing and attracting theme requires variety of knowledge. You need to have skill on some theme which is not your main theme.
* Survey on another theme is effective. Good idea may come from another theme.

### Technique: propose a few methods, not only one
You can discuss and compare them. Often there is a trade-off.
1. Simple solution
2. A little complicated, and more realistic method
3. Complicated method


## Ryo Suzuki (Stanford HCI Group)
This is based on his internship experiments in Stanford HCI Group. He focuses on productivity.

### The first step is the most important step
All the ideas in each paper published in big conferences are very cool. Mature people have great insight to predict whether the theme is interesting enough to be accepted by such conferences. The interesting point is that two experts probably agree with wether the theme is cool or not. You must not to compromise to decide your theme.

### It's not the an idea until you write it down
(This is quoted from Ivan Sutherland)
You should refine ideas through writing it down. Writing doesn't allow vague idea. Through writing, we can see vague points, which should be considered. Another reason is making contribution clear. To make it clear, you see what you have to focus on your contribution.

### The rest 2 weeks are periods for revision, not for writing
The students in his group know they can improve the quality of their papers only by revision. There are systems for 3-5 students to make reviews.
