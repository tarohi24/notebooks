## Engineering

### Version controlling

- Monorepo is not fake! It's true. And it's visible to all the Googler. Sending pathes is encouraged.
- Commit to the branch usually requires approval of one of their mainteiners.


### Softwares and Programming
- They use Bazel as the buliding tool.
- Protobuf is used as the most common protocol.
- They use an origial bug tracker called Buganizer.
- Google strongly recommends using each of C++, Java, Python, Go, or JavaScript.
  - Note: to limit language varieties, we will have the clear language list to which we have to offer API.
- Most codes are rewritten every few years.
  - Even though it's costly, it's a key to Google's agility and long-term success.
  - The rewriting also owes to transfer the ownership to the new members.
    - They engage more into the development if they feel they are owners of the code.


## Culture and Environments
- 20% rule: engineers can spend 20% of their time on any projects that they want to engage in
  - It's valuable partly because the amazing idea may not be recognized immediately.


## Managements
- OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are documents that consist of goals and progress toward the goals.
  - Every team is required to make the document. Each key should be measurable (quantitative).
  - While OKRs are independent of individuals' performance appraisals, we tend to score them well.
    - Thus they should be objective.
- Seats are re-assigned frequently (on average once in 6-12 months).
- Transfers between different parts of the company are recommended.
