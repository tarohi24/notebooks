Single Cell
=========

## Terms
- Transcription refers DNA to mRNA.
- Translation refers mRNA to protein.
- Gene expression = transcription + translation.


## How to gather single cells?

### Microarray
Microarray is a way to measure gene expression. First, prepare for probes, shrot complementary-DNAs and/or nucleotides. They are complementary to the targeting sequence. The spot probes on the slides. After that, hybridize them to mRNAs extracted from a cell. Gene expression is the amount of the luminous intensity. Errors during the measurement of intensity is not ignoreable; it's one of major problems in microarray method.
