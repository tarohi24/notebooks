## Image search

- This task is related to *specific object recognition*, which is a task to identify an "identical objects".
  - e,g, Google image search, face recognition

### What's challenging in object recognition
- Different scale
- Different viewpoints
- Occlusion
  - The phenomenon that a object in front hides another objcet in back.
- Effects of lights
- Time variation


### Traditional approach

Extract local descripters (features) mainly to gain the border between two objects and embed images by them (local â‰ƒ in part).

Such descripters should be invariant by the following effects:

- scale
- rotation
- lights


**invariants to scale** is achieved by laplacian of gaussian. Laplacian operator stresses the border (2nd derivation).  `maximum_filter` in scipy is helpful.  

**Invariants to rotation** is achieved by **SIFT**.

**Invariants to affine transformation** asserts a descripter is consistent no matter what linear transformations (scaling, move, rotation) are conducted. SIFT is not an affine-invatiant descripter. Instead, Root SIFT is an affine-invariant descripter. Root SIFT transforms an vector in a euclidean space so that euclidean distance between the transformed vector would be equivalent to hellinger distance between the original vectors.
