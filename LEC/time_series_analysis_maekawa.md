Time series analysis

Lecturer: Prof. Maekawa
This lectures focus especially on data obtained by sensors.


## Remove noise

### Filters
For instance: moving average $b(i) = \frac{1}{N}$

### Domain driven
For instance, human motion has low frequencies. Thus high-frequent data is probally noise.

### Low-pass filter

Low-pass filter is a filter that passes only the components that has lower frequency than specified.
