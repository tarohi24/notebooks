## Studies

(the following categories are from ACL Wiki)

### Lexical phrases
Methods which have in part syntax or pragmatics. This category is further classified into three classes in terms of types of expressions a method assumes.

- fixed expressions: e.g. while we can say *in short*, we cannot say *in very short*.
- semi-fixed expresssions: while word orders are invariable, minor variances such as determiner selection is possible. e.g. the rule of *kick the backet* also accepts *kicks the bucket*.

### Intuitionalized phrases
More compositional than lexical phrases.
